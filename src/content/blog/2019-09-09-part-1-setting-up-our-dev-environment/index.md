In Part 1 of this tutorial, we will collect the tools needed to spin up and edit a website. By the end, you will have a local environment set up and the space needed to start working on a project. 👏

<br/>

## Who this is for
You might be a:
- Designer
- Data Scientist
- Web Developer
- Interested person at any skill level looking to create a website (Welcome! 🎉)

<br/>

This tutorial is broken down into three parts:
- **Part 1**: Setting up our environment and running a project locally in our browser (You are here! 🏁)
- **Part 2**: Committing our work to Github
- **Part 3**: Deploying to a public url with Netlify

<br/>

We will be tackling a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project - not any frontend frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Angular](https://angular.io/). We'll save those for a rainy day.

_This tutorial shows a macOS environment, but you can apply the methods to other operating systems._


Let's go! 🚀
