In Part 1 of this tutorial, we will collect and utilize the basic tools you'll need to spin up and edit a website. By the end, you will have a local environment set up and the space needed to start working on a website, data visualization, or any other kind of web-based project. üëè

<br/>

#### You might be a:
- Designer
- Data Scientist
- Web Developer
- Interested person at any skill level looking to create a website (Welcome! üéâ)

<br/>

<!-- This tutorial is broken down into three parts:
- **Part 1**: Setting up our environment and running a project locally in our browser (You are here! üèÅ)
- **Part 2**: Committing our work to Github
- **Part 3**: Deploying to a public url with Netlify -->

## We got this

In Part 1 of this tutorial, we will collect and utilize the basic tools you'll need to spin up and edit a website. By the end, you will have a local environment set up and the space needed to start working on a site, data visualization, or any other kind of web-based project. üëè

#### You might be a:
- Designer
- Data Scientist
- Web Developer
- Person at any skill level looking to create a website (Welcome! üéâ)

<br/>

Note: We will be tackling a pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript project‚Ää-‚Äänot any frontend frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Angular](https://angular.io/). We'll save those for a rainy day.

Let's go! üöÄ

<br/>

## Collecting tools and¬†files

- the terminal
- Node and npm
- Server: Live server
- Text editor: Visual Studio Code
- Sample project: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (a demo site I put together for you)

<br/>

Don't worry if you've never used any of these tools‚ÄîI'll walk you through obtaining each.

<br/>

<!-- ### Terminal commands used in this¬†tutorial

- _add this to sidebar_

make directory
```
mkdir [directory-name]
```
<br/>

change directory (moves your terminal a level deeper into a folder)
```
cd [folder-name]
```
<br/>

change directory (moves your terminal up a level)
```
cd ..
```

<br/>
<br/> -->

### The terminal

If you've never used your terminal before, don't worry. We'll go over what the terminal is and commands needed for this tutorial.

Using your machine's terminal might look like the most daunting program to learn, but it isn't! With a few basic commands, we'll use it to move through directories (folders), create files, and run taks like starting a server.

![Terminal screenshot](./terminal.jpeg)

In a nutshell, the terminal (also known as the **command line**) is a way to interact with your computer. It is used to send commands to the computer like moving through files and folders, installing and running programs, creating and deleting documents, or anything else you do within your operating system. The command line used to be the _only_ way to interact with your computer‚Äîthink back to MS-DOS!

Even though command line GUIs (graphical user interfaces aka programs) exist, terminals are still commonly used in development. I find that I can do tasks more quickly within the terminal interface, whether that is navigating to a project and starting a server, using git, or run multiple environments at once. Since writing commands is like using a language, it gives me the freedom to express what exactly I'm trying to do.

And it all comes with time. When I first began my journey into web development, I only knew 1-2 commands and fudged my way through the rest by making tons of mistakes and googling everything.

<br/>

### Open your terminal

<br/>

**MacOS**: Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal

**Windows**: Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt

The images in this article show a MacOS environment and the iTerm terminal.

<br/>

### Navigation commands used in this¬†tutorial

Terminal commands will be shown in the following grey blocks with unicode text.

<br/>

**make directory** (Creates a folder aka directory. _Do not include the brackets when naming your directory._)
```
mkdir [folder-name]
```
<br/>

<br/>

**change directory** (Moves your terminal _down_ one level into a folder)
```
cd [folder-name]
```
<br/>

<br/>

**change directory** (Moves your terminal _up_ one level)
```
cd ..
```

<br/>
<br/>



### Node and npm

![Node homepage](./node-homepage.png)

<br/>

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a run-time environment for JavaScript. I.E. it helps you execute JavaScript code. No worries if you have no JavaScript experience!

You may already have Node installed. To check, open up your terminal, paste this command, and hit enter.

```
node -v
```

<br/>

![Check Node version](./terminal-node-version.png)

<br/>

If Node is not installed, the terminal will say that Node is not found. Head to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/), download the LTS version on the left, and follow the installation instructions. After installing, running the `node -v` command will return the Node version, verifying that Node is installed on your machine.

<br/>
<br/>

### Server: Live Server

Live Server is an application that runs on your computer with the use of server software and it allows you to run your project's JavaScript code. Essentially, this mimics a server that your website will be deployed on once it's out on the internet.

[Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) is a wonderful and free development server that comes with a hot reload capability (automatically refreshing your browser anytime a saved change is detected).

To install, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g live-server
```

<br/>

<PostNote>
    <p className="PostNote__content">
        If you are seeing permission errors, you may need to add <code>sudo</code> to the beginning of this command to grant admin access. <code>sudo</code> gives you super-user permission to modify your computer. This is common issue for those using macOS.

</PostNote>

<br/>
<br/>

_If_ you need to add `sudo`:
```
sudo npm install -g live-server
```

<br/>
<br/>

### Text Editor
_You may already have a text editor you prefer to use. Skip this section if you don't want to install VSCode._

![Visual Studio homepage](./vscode-homepage.png)

<br/>

A text editor is a program that allows you to write and edit all the code for your project in a range of programming languages.

The text editor in this tutorial's screenshots is Visual Studio code.

I switched to using VSCode last year and like the large the large extension library and themes. (Regarding themes: I prefer light text editor themes as toggling between a light browser and dark editor causes eye strain for me. I am currently using the GitHub Plus theme, seen in the screenshots in this tutorial).

To install VSCode, head to (code.visualstudio.com)[https://code.visualstudio.com], download, and follow the installation instructions.¬†

Other editors:
- Sublime text
- Atom


<br/>
<br/>

### Project and file organization

If this is your first dev project, I recommend keeping all project folders (future repos) organized in the same location. My repos are organized in a folder named _repos_ located in my User root folder.

![Finder organization](./finder-files.png)

<br/>

When you open a new terminal window, it will default your User root folder (for me that is margueriteroth). By having my repos folder here, I can easily navigate my terminal to the repos  folder and a project. I suggest keeping your projects in a similar spot.¬†

To create a new folder in your User root (your name) via the command line, open your terminal and make a repos folder:

```
mkdir repos
```

<br/>

Navigate inside your repos folder (aka change directory! ü§™):

```
cd repos
```

<br/>

And copy (clone) the sample project:

```
git clone git@github.com:margueriteroth/our-new-project.git
```

<br/>
<br/>

![Terminal screenshot: git clone](./terminal-git-clone.png)

<br/>

_If you don't want to use the terminal for this, create a `repos` folder the way you normally create new folders and directly download and unzip the project files: https://github.com/margueriteroth/our-new-project/archive/master.zip._

<br/>

After downloading, the sample project will appear in your `repos` folder. Point your terminal into this new project folder:

```
cd our-new-project
```
<br/>

Here you will find our three project files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `scripts.js` (the README.md is only used for the github repo description. Feel free to ignore it!).

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Overview of the HTML, CSS, and JS¬†files

<br/>

### index.html

The default page for sites is `index.html`. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. A markup language is a set of instructions on how to create a document, like a webpage for your browser. Markdown is another type of markup language.


<PostNote isBlue>
    <p className="PostNote__content">
        HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as FILL THIS OUT
    </p>
    <Link
        className="PostNote__link"
        to="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
        doOpenInNewTab>
        From the MDN web docs
    </Link>
</PostNote>





### styles.css

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is a styling language used to style the HTML elements (ie. element size, color, placement, font, etc.). Within a CSS file, you target DOM elements using ids, classes, tags, and style using CSS syntax.¬†

You may have seen CSS preprocessor files around:¬†.less,¬†.sass, and¬†.scss, and a few others. Preprocessors are CSS-like language that compiles into CSS for use by a browser. They allow us to write CSS with less repetition and added functionally like mixins and color functions.¬†

To keep things simple, we are sticking with regular CSS for this tutorial.

<br/>
<br/>

### scripts.js

This is where our JavaScript lives. JavaScript is a client side scripting language used by your browser‚Ää-‚Ääit makes our static page intelligent (not to be confused with the Java programming language). With JavaScript, you can do things like complex interactions, calculations, and more.¬†

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) are examples of common JavaScript libraries.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Running the sample project

Okay, the good part. Now that we have installed all our tools and downloaded the sample project, it is time to fire this baby up.¬†

Open your terminal and navigate from your User root folder to the project files folder.

```
cd our-new-project
```

<br/>

For the server to run our project, the server command needs to run while in the project folder, which we just navigated to in the step above. This is where our html, css, and js files live. Otherwise, the server won't know which files to serve.

Start the server üî•

```
live-server
```

<br/>

A browser tab should automatically open at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

<br/>

![Terminal screenshot: starting live-server](./terminal-live-server.png)

![Sample project homepage!](./project-homepage.png)

<br/>

_Weet woo!_


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Editing the¬†files

Start VSCode and open the `our-new-project` folder. Your terminal is already running the `live-server` from this same folder location.

<br/>

![Open VSCode](./vscode-open.png)

![View HTML in VSCode](./vscode-html.png)

<br/>

In `index.html` we have a basic html structure with our content inside of the `<body>` tag. To see hot reload in action, let's edit the `<h1>` and save.

<br/>

## Next steps

The world is our oyster. Continue editing the project files!


## Additional sample projects

### D3.js

D3.js is a powerful library full of visualization tools, but where to start?

[Sample project using D3.js]()

D3.js has a steep learning curve, but thankfully there are some amazing resources out there.

#### D3.js resources
- [Fullstack D3 book by Amelia Wattenberger]()
- [Scott Murray Book])() (this book uses an older version of d3, but the foundations covered are still helpful)
- [d3 page by Amelia]()
- [Blockus or whatever he calls it]()
- [Observable? so weird to use]()


<br/>


### CSS Frameworks

Maybe you want to use a CSS framework. CSS frameworks are collection of stylesheets that contain preset styles. For example, instead of styling a button with its hover and active states for every project, you can utilize a CSS framework to quickly style your buttons with one class name declaration.

[Sample project using Bootstrap]()

Common CSS Frameworks:
- [Bootstrap]()
- [Tailwind]()
- [Foundation]()
