In Part 1 of this tutorial, we will collect the tools needed to spin up and edit a website. By the end, you will have a local environment set up and the space needed to start working on a project. 👏

<br/>

## Who this is for
You might be a:
- Designer
- Data Scientist
- Web Developer
- Interested person at any skill level looking to create a website (Welcome! 🎉)

<br/>

<!-- This tutorial is broken down into three parts:
- **Part 1**: Setting up our environment and running a project locally in our browser (You are here! 🏁)
- **Part 2**: Committing our work to Github
- **Part 3**: Deploying to a public url with Netlify -->


We will be tackling a pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript project - not any frontend frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Angular](https://angular.io/). We'll save those for a rainy day.

Let's go! 🚀

<br/>
<br/>

### Tools and files

- Terminal: iTerm2 (optional)
- Node and npm
- Server: Live server
- Text editor: Visual Studio Code
- Sample project: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (Demo site)

<br/>

### Terminal commands used in this tutorial

make directory
```
mkdir [directory-name]
```
<br/>

change directory (moves your terminal a level deeper into a folder)
```
cd [folder-name]
```
<br/>

change directory (moves your terminal up a level)
```
cd ..
```


### Terminal: iTerm
*Feel free to skip installing iTerm2. Your default Terminal will work for this tutorial.*

    console.log("bananas");
    console.log("bees");

```js
class Chart extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // when Chart mounts, do this
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (prevProps.data == props.data) return
    // when data updates, do this
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // before Chart unmounts, do this
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <svg className="Chart" />
    )
  }
}
```
