## Introducing [Currents](https://currents.parsely.com)

[Currents](https://currents.parsely.com) is a real-time and historical dashboard showcasing the relationship between content production and attention.

With Currents you can explore top performing topics, categories, stories, referrers, and more. You can also dive into content production dataâ€”what is being written about and when.

**About the data:**
Parse.ly's other analytics offering, [Parse.ly Analytics](https://parse.ly), measures content performance on thousands of websites. Currents aggregates and anonymizes those sitesâ€™ data to create a one-of-a-kind view of the relationship between content production and attention.

## Info Page deep dive

![Currents dashboard info timeline](./currents-info-timeline.png)

The Currents Info page is the bread-and-butter of this product. Inside this page you can create many types of data queries and explore numerous metrics.

### Search

![Currents search interface](./currents-search.png)

<br/>

The Info Page search interface allows you to search multiple types of attention and content production data:

**Categories:**
What categories the article covers (eg. *business*, *sports*)

**Topics:**
What people, places, and things the article mentions (eg. *Obama*, *jalapeÃ±o*)

**Traffic sources:**
The site or app people used to discover the articles (eg *twitter*, *google*)

**Traffic source categories:**
The type of site, app, or method people used to discover articles (eg *search*, *social media*)

**Market areas:**
The location of people reading articles, based on [media markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market)

**US States:**
The U.S. state where people are reading articles

**Stories:**
The broad news story article groups are about

**Sites:**
What site the article was published on

**Site sizes:**
The size of the site the article was published on

<br/>
<br/>

A common use case is comparing referrer traffic: **Which platform is referring more visitors to articles&mdash;Facebook, Google, or Twitter?** This can help inform a content distribution plan.

### Timeline

![Currents dashboard info timeline breakdown](./currents-info-timeline-breakdown.png)

The timeline shows views over time, articles published over time, and historical trends. One of my favorite components is the query phrase above the timeline&mdash;it becomes increasingly helpful the more complex a query becomes.

### Query Stats

![Query info stats for views, articles, and demand](./currents-infostats.png)

Query stats for query items are broken down into **views**, **articles**, and **demand** (the average number of views for each article).

Here we see that even though more total articles are referred by Google than by Facebook, articles are around 5x more in _demand_ for Facebook than for Twitter or Google.

Providing both the analysis phrase and the stacked bar charts gives users multiple ways to understand the information.

### Weekly and daily trends

See how query traffic compares against **all traffic** over days and weeks.

### Top stories and articles

Currents analyzes the full text of articles in to understand what theyâ€™re about. If there is enough data to quanitfy the existence of a story, story data will suface in this section. Articles that are about a single event or issue are grouped into a story. The name of a story comes from the topics most relevant to it.

Unfortunatley stories about Donald Trump are frequently in a Top Story spot. ðŸ¤¬

Currents also surfaces a random sampling of articles people are reading from the query's traffic data.

### Traffic locations

            <source src={videoMap} type="video/mp4" />

    </div>

Here you can dive into traffic based on US location. Originally we wanted to show full world maps, but we quickly learned that our dataset is skewed towards US and some European locations.

You can view both total views and views relative to the average. Since California, Texas, and New York have large populations, these total views on average will always be high comparatively. To account for situations like this, we allow users to view both raw view counts and relative views. This also allows us to show areas above and below the average amount.

## Dashboard conception

#### Project sprint

In January 2018 when we began this project, we wanted to quickly verify decisions while learning about the dataset we were exploring. We decided to have a modified Sprint.
