## What is Currents?

Currents is a real-time and historical dashboard showcasing the relationship between content production and attention.

With Currents you can explore top performing topics, categories, stories, referrers, and more. You can also dive into content production data—what is being written about and when.

**About the data:**
Parse.ly Analytics measures content performance on thousands of websites. Currents aggregates and anonymizes those sites’ data to create a one-of-a-kind view of the relationship between content production and attention.
